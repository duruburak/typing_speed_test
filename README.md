The test starts as you start typing. Pressing space make a jump to the next word, any mistyped letter gets colored red.

The words you type that exceed the intended word will not be counted.
e.g. The word: lemon. You typed: lemona. It still counts as correct word.

The App is not case-sensitive for English, however you should always use lowercase while typing in Turkish.
